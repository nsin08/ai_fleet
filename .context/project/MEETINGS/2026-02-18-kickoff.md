# Kickoff Notes - 2026-02-18

## Attendees

- @nsin08
- Codex assistant

## Current Repository State

- Governance and templates are configured (`space_framework` based).
- No application code committed yet.

## Decisions Captured

1. Architecture and durable project docs will be created first.
2. Simulation data will be persisted in a database, not only in memory.
3. Simulation will operate as telemetry replay to mimic real device data lifecycle.
4. Application implementation will be containerized first.
5. `README.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` will be updated after architecture/components are finalized.
6. Architecture baseline is Hexagonal + SOLID + 12-Factor.
7. AI provider baseline is Ollama for demo, with cloud-replaceable adapter strategy.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Finalize component boundaries (web, api, replay, db, shared types).
2. Define database schema for master data, telemetry, events, alerts, scenarios.
3. Create container baseline and startup flow.
4. Begin monorepo scaffolding aligned with governance workflows.
