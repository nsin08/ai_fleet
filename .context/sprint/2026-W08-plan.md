# Sprint 2026-W08

**Dates:** 2026-02-16 to 2026-02-22

## Goals
- Finalize implementation-ready architecture baseline (Hexagonal, SOLID, 12-Factor).
- Define executable delivery path for container-first stack (`web`, `api`, `db`, Ollama).
- Convert architecture and contracts into actionable, governable backlog items.
- Prepare repo for Phase 1 implementation (scaffold + schema + seeds).

## Backlog
- Story #TBD: Monorepo scaffold (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/shared`) with workspace tooling and container setup.
- Story #TBD: Seed pipeline for `seed_entities`, `routes`, `scenarios`, and AI templates into DB.
- Story #TBD: Replay engine core (deterministic tick loop, scenario run lifecycle, state projection).
- Story #TBD: Live ingestion mode with scaled `vehicle-emitter-*` containers and ingest APIs.
- Story #TBD: Docker Compose topology with profiles (`core`, `ops`, `emitters`) and type-wise scale commands.
- Story #TBD: Rule engine core (overspeed, harsh brake, fuel anomaly, geofence breach, off-route, DTC trigger).
- Story #TBD: API baseline and WebSocket contract implementation per `.context/project/COMPONENTS_AND_API_CONTRACTS.md`.
- Story #TBD: Ollama adapter (`AiInferencePort`) with model/env config and fallback behavior.
- Story #TBD: CI updates for containerized checks and schema/seed validation.

## Completed
- [x] Created architecture baseline doc: `.context/project/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- [x] Added ADRs for container-first, DB replay, governance-first, and architecture principles.
- [x] Added explicit component and API contracts: `.context/project/COMPONENTS_AND_API_CONTRACTS.md`.
- [x] Added kickoff notes and operational runbooks under `.context/project/`.
- [x] Added Docker Compose design runbook with concrete service names and scaling commands.
- [x] Added PostgreSQL v1 migration artifact: `db/migrations/0001_init.sql`.
- [x] Added schema reference doc: `.context/project/DB_SCHEMA.md`.

## Metrics
- Velocity: Baseline pending (first implementation sprint not started).
- Bugs found: 0 (no application runtime yet).
- Average cycle time: Baseline pending.

## Notes
- Key learnings: Governance-first setup is stable; architecture and contracts are now sufficiently defined to begin implementation.
- Blockers encountered: No code scaffold exists yet; issue IDs need to be created and moved through `space_framework` state machine before coding stories.
- Improvements for next sprint: Add explicit story point estimates and acceptance criteria mapping for each backlog item before execution.
